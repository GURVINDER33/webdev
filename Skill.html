                    I worked on a personal web development project, where I learned CSS, jQuery, object-oriented programming, and valuable knowledge in the backend <br> process of how to make the websites look more professional. <br> Grade 8 mathematics demonstrates my sharp focus and acute observation in general; <br>  with these skills, I can grasp new concepts effectively. Working according to the course framework, which includes a lot of algorithms <br> and data structure content was one of the things I performed to earn a spot at a university and have a decent knowledge <br>  of these topics. I was a participant on platforms like Leet code <hr> and Code wars and was able to learn advanced topics in Programming languages Practice and consistency have increased my knowledge in Computer Science.
                    Some skills that I have gained professionally are, <br>
                    time management and team working while working at an accountancy company </p> 
                    
                    <p id="space"> in my work experience days where I had helped the <br>
                    staff and showed the same tactics related to their work such as converting pdf to excel straightforwardly, <br>
                    I have helped the company save time and my contribution to the company was valuable, where they invited me to work <br>
                    with them again. My hobbies include fitness and engaging in physical activity and playing cricket as a captain, <br> which has taught me discipline and leadership skills. I always participated in my school's sports club and I once recorded my fastest <br>
                        running speed which was 22.8 mph, because of a month's tough sprinting training. Moreover, In the activity clubs I enjoyed collaborating with others and always respected their perspectives and judgments.
