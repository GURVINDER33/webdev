                    Programming, something that makes me think deeply, consumes all my mental capacity, and when I succeed at that given problem, the feeling I get is unbelievably awesome,<br> it keeps my brain efficient, I was keen to know how code makes things work, then I decided to study computer <br> science as a subject in High school, I am constantly learning to program, and I feel passionate about it, this way I have been improving my logical and programming skills. <br> One of my skills is designing websites, as a result of completing a website building course, <br> I am now capable of designing and deploying a website for small businesses on the internet, <br> from registering a domain name to hosting a website, Computer Science inspires me since </p> <p id="space">  there is always something technical to learn and progress in life. In college, I loved programming because it gave me the satisfaction of solving a problem. For instance, I wrote a python code regarding an airline ticket company that lets customers buy plane tickets. I admire computer scientists like John von Neumann and Alan Turing, who have gained huge success and respect as a result of their computer science knowledge and are the reason we can use computers so readily and in such a straightforward manner.
                    <br> <br> <hr> <br> <br> <br>   Most of the computer science research was done on my own because it took a lot of effort and time to grasp the fundamentals, particularly <br> in the practical rather than theoretical aspects. The independent study involved watching theoretical Computer <br> Science and programming tutorials, following them, and analyzing the code and how it accomplishes a task. When I joined college, <br> I tried building a website as it was a topic and, in that experience, I Gained valuable skills that would help in website development
